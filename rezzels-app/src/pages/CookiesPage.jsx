          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            Cookies are tiny spies we place on your device to track your every move, thought, and potential purchase. Think of them as little digital stalkers that follow you around the internet, taking detailed notes about everything you do. Creepy? Absolutely! Legal? Somehow, yes!
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            Unlike real cookies, ours don't taste good and provide zero nutritional value. They do, however, feed our insatiable hunger for your personal data.

          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are "essential" for us to invade your privacy. Without them, how would we know what you had for breakfast?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            <strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> These measure how quickly you get annoyed by our pop-ups and how many times you try to close them before giving up.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            <strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These remember your preferences, like your favorite color, your childhood pet's name, and the answers to your security questions. You know, for "functionality."
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            <strong>Targeting Cookies:</strong> These follow you around the internet like a clingy ex, reminding you of that one product you looked at for 2 seconds three weeks ago.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            <strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> We invite all our friends to place their cookies on your device too! The more the merrier! It's like a cookie party, and your device is the unwilling host.

            <strong>Experimental Mind-Control Cookies:</strong> Still in beta testing. Please ignore any sudden urges to buy our entire inventory.

            3. How to Manage Cookies (Good Luck With That)
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            You can theoretically manage your cookie preferences by navigating our intentionally confusing settings menu. We've designed it to be so complicated that you'll eventually give up and just click "Accept All." Our UX designer was previously employed by a labyrinth construction company.

            If you somehow figure out how to disable our cookies, don't worry‚Äîwe have backup tracking methods, including but not limited to browser fingerprinting, device tracking, and a small team of psychics who can predict your shopping habits.

          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" className="section-text">
            Our cookies have impressive lifespans. Some stick around for a session, others for a few months, and our special "Forever Cookies" will outlive human civilization. Archaeologists in the year 3000 will dig up your device and still find our cookies tracking your long-forgotten purchase of a hoodie.

            We're particularly proud of our "Zombie Cookies" that resurrect themselves even after you delete them. They're like the horror movie villain that keeps coming back no matter how many times you think you've defeated them.

            We reserve the right to change this policy at any time without notifying you. We might add new types of cookies, remove old ones, or replace them all with something even more invasive. It's like a surprise party, but for privacy violations!

            We recommend checking this policy every 15 minutes to stay updated. Or don't. It doesn't matter because you've already accepted our cookies anyway.
